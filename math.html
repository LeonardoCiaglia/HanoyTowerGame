						<h3>Mathematical Formulation:</h3> 
						<p>The Tower of Hanoi problem can be mathematically formulated using recursive algorithms and mathematical induction. The recursive solution is elegant, demonstrating the power of mathematical thinking in problem-solving. The mathematical formula for the minimum number of moves (2^n - 1) is derived through the recursive nature of the problem, where each move involves a smaller subproblem.</p>
